When it gets back to the teammates shaking hands with eachother it gets a little harder because they all shake hands with eachother once. I found that there are two ways to calculate this; either you can do 11-1 and count down for each increment and then take the sum so it would look like 10+9+8+... or you can just divide it by 2 because they have to pair with eachother into couples to shake eachothers hands."

The variable total people probably wasn't super necessary but now you can do this with a greater number of people by changing up stuff. How I went about this is if your partner shook hands with everyone (8 people), you would've had to shake zero hands and then that pattern keeps repeating for each couple. It keeps incrementing down one each time because of the person before them shaking hands with them and you can't shake hands with them again and also everyone gives back a different number. There is 4 twice because that would be Mr/Mrs. Smith."
